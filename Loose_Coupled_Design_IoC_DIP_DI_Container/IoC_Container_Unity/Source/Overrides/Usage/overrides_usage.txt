Unity container allows us to override a registered type by using ResolverOverride. 
The ResolverOverride is an abstract class that provides implementation for overriding registration. 
There are three important classes which inherit ResolverOverride:

ParameterOverride: Used to override constructor parameters.
PropertyOverride: Used to override the value of a specified property.
DependencyOverride: Used to override the type of dependency and its value.
